## Kaggle Competition 

Compete in the [CPU Prediction](http://inclass.kaggle.com/c/model-t4/data) Kaggle competition.  It is a regression problem with a fair amount of features so Ridge and LASSO might work well.  Remember, try to use models you understand and do not be swayed to use overly complex algorithms.  Since it is still on going, you can submit your solution and get scored to compete against other data scientists!  Use what you have learned in the first 3 weeks of class to work your way up the leader board.

__If you want to organize a team from other students who have finished the sprint, feel free to make a team of 3-5 students__

## Tools: 

Before you dive into regression, algorithms and testing talk to your partner/team and devise a strategy for analyzing the data. Work effectively so that you can communicate your findings in a presentation. Use any of the tools we learnt this week (here are some suggestions...):

<u> Use EDA techniques: </u>

* Visualize the data set and understand your variables. 
* Look for the categorical and continuous regressors. 
* Use faceting or stratification to identify collinearity.

<u> Use the big guns:</u> 

* Linear regression
* Ridge regression
* Lasso regression 


<u>Remove biases in data using:</u>

* Detecting and reducing Multicollinearity 
* Heteroscedasticity
* Influence and leverage points, and outliers.

<u> Test your predictions: </u>

* Use cross validation and k-fold to test for overfitting

Good Luck!
