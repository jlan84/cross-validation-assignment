* [Extra summary notes](notes.md)

## Exercise

Morning exercise in [individual.md](individual.md) and afternoon in [pair.md](pair.md).

## Extra credit

1. Implement Stepwise Regression as described in [individual.md](individual.md#extra-credit-stepwise-regression)
2. Compete in the Kaggle Competition in [extra.md](extra.md) with a small group of other students.  The competition has no submission deadline so you should be able to see how you stack up against others.
